Our findings and experiment details are present in the paper published in<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2532802&dl=ACM&coll=DL" target="dl-acm"><i>Software Engineering notes</i></a>. Of course, it is behind a paywall. Find the original file <a href="https://goo.gl/nE216H" taget="dl-acm-alternate">here</a></p>

<h2> Presentations </h2>

<p> I am keen and interested in the fields of education, energy, connectivity and e-commerce. On the topic of Education awareness, I have made some presentations during our college Tech-Fest which are available online.</p>

<h3> 1. Paths after High School </h3>
<p> This presentation talks about various departments and opportunities available after high school. The general presumption from the place where I come from is the only viable branches are <i>Doctor</i> and <i>Engineering</i>. This presentation was intended to say otherwise. <br/>
  You can find the presentation <a href="sugavaneshb.github.io/disha-pragyan-13" target= "disha-pragyan">here</a>. This was made with HTML5 Presentation toolkit - RevealJS.</p>

<h3> 2. Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering </h3>
<p> CS degree is the hotbed of talks and a dream for a lot of young kids who dream of learning to build video games and software comparable to google. This talk aims at distilling facts from fiction about what one learns in CS and what can he expect as a career in future. <br/>
  You can find the presentation <a href="http://sugavaneshb.github.io/disha-pragyan-13/psr_cs" target="cs-psr">here</a>. This was also made with RevealJS. </p>
